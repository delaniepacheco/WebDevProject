<h1> About Me </h1>
<p>     My full name is Delanie Pacheco Quintana. I am a first generation Mexican American college student. I have not always known what I wanted to do as a career.
I only knew that I had to make my parents proud. As the first daughter to my Mexican parents I have always felt the need to be successful so that I could help them out. 
My parents did so much for me and provided me with everything I have ever needed. They did this with struggles of language barriers, missing their family, and culture differences.
Since I started school I always tried by best because I loved making my parents proud. It was hard because I would feel like it was never enough. I always wanted to be better and better. 
I grew up feeling pretty misunderstood by a lot of people around me. I truly did not see my future when I was younger. </p>

   <p> As I started to get older and seeing life in a different way I have been able to realize that I truly love to learn. I love to learn new things and experience the world around me. 
I love to travel and I love to meet new people and build meaningful connections. I am a very deep thinker, which is maybe why I always felt misunderstood. I felt like I would think of things others wouldn't.
However, I realize thats not the case. I realized I had to be more open and let people actually get to know me. I have grown a lot as a person as I have been navigating life as an adult. </p>

  <p>I found my love for learning about technology when I started college back in 2020. It was something that was challenging for me. I wanted to know I could learn to do something new from start to finish. Learning how to code was one of the most challenging tasks ever.
However, it helped me realize that anything is possible as long as you put your mind to it. It helped me with my confidence and of course helped me expand my problem solving skills.
I then started to see how much I love to be a leader. I love helping people and and encouraging them to do their best. I would like to have a leadership/management career in an IT field in the future. 
I feel like I am a good team player and good at communicating to lead a team to success. I am currently in a management position at CarMax and I hope to keep growing in my role.

At this moment my goal is to get my bachelors degree and find myself a career where I can thrive and interact with people. 

 </p>

<p2> WORDS I WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE MYSELF:
    EMPATHETIC,
    AMBITIOUS ,
    CARING,
    KIND,
    HARDWORKING
